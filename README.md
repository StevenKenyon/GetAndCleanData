## This is the README.md file for the Course Project in the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Class.
Iâ€™ve put everything in a single script.
If you choose to run the script you will probably want to set your working directory to a place where this data can go, as all the data will be downloaded and manipulated from your current working directory.
The steps taken in this transformation script are:
1.	Download and unzip the dataset
2.	Merge the training and test data to a single data set
3.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4.	Assign descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5.	Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
6.	Write the first data set to files
7.	Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
8.	Write the second data set to a file.
